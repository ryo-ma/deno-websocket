ðŸ¦• A simple WebSocket library like [ws of node.js library](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for deno

This library is wrapping the [ws standard library](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/tree/main/ws) as a server-side and the [native WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) as a client-side. 
You can receive callbacks at the EventEmitter and can use the same object format on both the server-side and the client-side.


* Deno >= 1.8.3

Server side

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net https://deno.land/x/websocket@v0.1.4/example/server.ts
```

Client side

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net https://deno.land/x/websocket@v0.1.4/example/client.ts
ws connected! (type 'close' to quit)
> something
```

## Usage

Server side

```typescript
import { WebSocketClient, WebSocketServer } from "https://deno.land/x/websocket@v0.1.4/mod.ts";

const wss = new WebSocketServer(8080);
wss.on("connection", function (ws: WebSocketClient) {
  ws.on("message", function (message: string) {
    console.log(message);
    ws.send(message);
  });
});

```

Client side

```typescript
import { WebSocketClient, StandardWebSocketClient } from "https://deno.land/x/websocket@v0.1.4/mod.ts";
const endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:8080";
const ws: WebSocketClient = new StandardWebSocketClient(endpoint);
ws.on("open", function() {
  console.log("ws connected!");
  ws.send("something");
